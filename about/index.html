            <p>
                I'm a seventeen year old indie developer from the Czech Republic. 
                I started my development journey around the age of 14, learning the three web
                technologies: HTML, CSS and JS. When I got a decent hang of these 
                technologies I moved forward, learning Angular and further developing
                my skills with the three base web technologies. A break came in 2017
                with the first release of Google's Flutter framework, which introduced
                me to mobile development. The last shift came when I got my first MacBook
                at the end of 2019 and learned iOS and macOS development, both using 
                native UIKit / AppKit frameworks coupled with Swift and Objective-C, and
                Apple's new cross-platform SwiftUI framework.
